          <p>By upgrading your health you can also
upgrade your performance. By having all of your bodily systems working for you, rather than against you, you’ll find that gaining strength, skill and the body you desire becomes much easier to do. By doing all the things that best support your health you’ll find 
your body will automatically move towards looking its best. This is because form follows function. Optimize the function of your systems and “the system” will look and work great.</p>
<p>Your energy will improve. So will your cognition and your ability to be productive and hit any goal you desire. Great health is one thing many successful people have in common.</p>
     <p>Most of what we focus on in this series could be called the basics. However as you’ll come to see, there are lots of details that can go into these basics. We’ll dive deep into each topic giving you every detail I can give from all of my research and personal experimentation to help you upgrade where you‘re at.</p>

        <header>The Importance of Testosterone</header>
        <article>
          <p>Testosterone is one of the most important hormones in the human body. It is used by both men and women, though men have roughly 7-8 times the testosterone as an adult, over children. And 20 times the daily production, about 4 to 7 milligrams a day, than women do. Estrogen is considered the female hormone equivalent, which males have as well, just in smaller amounts. At least typically. With endocrine disruption in both men and women, in older age many men can have higher estrogen levels than their wives.</p>
<p>A deficiency of testosterone has been linked to the following issues:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Depression</li>
            <li>Inability to Focus, Concentrate and Remember</li>
            <li>Anxiety</li>
            <li>Increased Fat especially in the Abdomen</li>
            <li>Decreased Libido</li>
            <li>Erectile Dysfunction</li>
            <li>Reduced Muscle Mass and Strength</li>
            <li>Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Disease, Stroke and Heart Attacks</li>
            <li>Accelerated Aging</li>
            <li>Irritability or Anger</li>
            <li>Fatigue</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Contrast this to the benefits of high testosterone. As an anabolic substance, testosterone causes increased protein synthesis allowing for faster and better recovery, which leads to increased muscle mass as well and increased bone density. Its role in sex is obvious and it may be even more important for attitude as it acts as a neurohormone. High testosterone gives you the feeling that you can “Take on the World”. For this reason optimizing testosterone has become an important part of not just performance but for health in all areas.</p>

          <p>We’ll be diving deep into the details of working to optimize individual hormones as listed earlier. All of these advanced steps work, but if you don’t cover the basics, you’re probably not going to get the optimal results you desire.</p>
          <p>What are the basics?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Drink plenty of high quality water</li>
            <li>Get quality and quantity of sleep</li>
            <li>Get the right kind of exercise</li>
            <li>Have a self-responsible, confident, positive mental outlook and be an “alpha”</li>
            <li>Eat organic and high-nutrient density food</li>
            <li>Manage your stress</li>

      <section class="main-section" id="Battling_Testosterone’s_Enemies,_the_Anti-Androgens">
        <header>Battling Testosterone’s Enemies, the Anti-Androgens</header>
        <p>More important than working on increasing testosterone itself is to combat all the many things, the anti-androgens, that can diminish testosterone’s abilities, convert it to the opposite, or render it inert. We’ll be covering the increasing aspect, but this area is where to start. That’s because having good to optimal testosterone typically takes care of itself IF you do the things in this section. You are a man. You are meant to have good levels of testosterone. It’s these things that stand in the way.</p>
        <p>Having the lab numbers from testing is going to best allow you to narrow in on what you do. That being said, I’ve ordered these steps in a way that I think would be appropriate for just about any man to follow. The first two especially are something we MUST do living in the environment we live in today.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Limit Endocrine Disruptors</li>
            <li>Detox Endocrine Disruptors</li>
            <li>Lower Cortisol</li>
            <li> Lower Aromatase</li>
            <li>Lower SHBG</li>
            <li> Lower Prolactin</li>
          </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Increasing_Testosterone_and_Its_Allies">
        <header>Increasing Testosterone and Its Allies</header>
        <p>Now that we’ve cut down and battled the anti-androgens, the dark side of male hormone health, it’s time to focus on the light side, specifically working with testosterone and its various allies.</p>
        <p>Understand that fighting the anti-androgens is probably more than half of the battle. If you take care of those things, then chances are you’ll see a big boost in your health and performance. And when you add in these steps it will do even more. Remember that many of these hormones can get trapped in vicious cycles, meaning the worse off you are the harder it 
becomes. This also means you can get stuck in the opposite, in virtuous cycles, where the better off you are, the easier it is to stay that way.</p>
        <p>Some of these steps include specific nutrients, which are necessary building blocks. From there we turn our focus to the cells themselves then the specific hormones and what we can do to increase them.</p>
         <ul>
            <li> Micronutrients</li>
            <li>Sunshine and Vitamin D</li>
            <li> Cell Receptor Health</li>
            <li> LH and Other T Precursors</li>
            <li> Testosterone</li>
            <li> DHT</li>
          </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="The_Macro-Nutrient_Wars">
        <header>The Macro-Nutrient Wars</header>
          <p>As you’ll come to see, the micro-nutrients that we consume, vitamins and minerals may be even more important than the macronutrients. That’s because people tend to get “enough” macronutrients, whereas they can be chronically depleted of many micronutrients.</p>
          <p>Still some focus on the three macronutrients is useful, when it comes to testosterone optimization. The three macronutrients are fat, carbohydrates and protein. Of course, not all fats are the same, not all carbs are the same, and not all protein is the same. Still, we’ll use these three groupings to talk about what is important for hormone health</p>
          <p>If we want to distill it all down to something simple, it is you want a good amount of each, carbs, protein and fat, without having too much, for optimal hormone production.</p>

        <header>The Testosterone Action Plan and Checklist</header>
        <article>
          <p>We’ve covered a ton of information. And there’s no way you can do it all so don‘t even think about that. Instead I want to break down this information into an action plan for you.The big idea behind that is that, no matter where you are at, you can continually upgrade yourself. The goal here is optimized testosterone, and of course that means optimized estrogen, aromatization, SHBG, DHT and more as well.</p>
          <p>Since this issue is bigger than most I’ve done, instead of a simple list, I’ve decided to break things up into the different big areas and then give you a checklist for each one that encapsulates just about everything from this book. Of course, more could be added but this definitely will give you enough of a simple and advanced place to start with.</p>

          <p>We can’t deny the placebo effect as a possible powerful stimulator of testosterone either. If you intention is to boost testosterone, assuming you’re not working from a place of psychological reversal, this intention alone is likely to help.</p>
          <p>While it’s great to have scientific study giving “proof” about what works and what doesn’t, not everything can or will get studied. And just because something was found to work for a group of people doesn’t mean it will work for you.</p>
          <p>You’ll have to experiment to find what works best for you and your body. I want you to develop your own protocol. By protocol I mean something that involves more than one step. While everyone wants to take the “magic pill”, and some of the herbs can act like that at times, by stacking together multiple things you’ll surely get even more benefits. High testosterone must become part of your lifestyle.</p>
