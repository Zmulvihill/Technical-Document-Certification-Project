          <p>By upgrading your health you can also 
upgrade your performance. By having all of your 
bodily systems working for you, rather than against 
you, you’ll find that gaining strength, skill and the 
body you desire becomes much easier to do. By doing 
all the things that best support your health you’ll find 
your body will automatically move towards looking 
its best. This is because form follows function. 
Optimize the function of your systems and “the
system” will look and work great.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your energy will improve. So will your cognition and your ability to be productive and hit 
any goal you desire. Great health is one thing many successful people have in common.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most of what we focus on in this series could be called the basics. However as you’ll come 
to see, there are lots of details that can go into these basics. We’ll dive deep into each topic 
giving you every detail I can give from all of my research and personal experimentation to 
help you upgrade where you‘re at.

        <header>The Importance of Testosterone</header>
        <article>
          <p>Testosterone is one of the most important hormones in the human body. It is used by both 
men and women, though men have roughly 7-8 times the testosterone as an adult, over 
children. And 20 times the daily production, about 4 to 7 milligrams a day, than women 
do. Estrogen is considered the female hormone equivalent, which males have as well, just 
in smaller amounts. At least typically. With endocrine disruption in both men and women, 
in older age many men can have higher estrogen levels than their wives.</p>

<p>
  A deficiency of testosterone has been linked to the following issues:
</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Depression</li>
            <li>Inability to Focus, Concentrate and Remember</li>
            <li>Anxiety</li>
            <li>Increased Fat especially in the Abdomen</li>
            <li>Decreased Libido</li>
            <li>Erectile Dysfunction</li>
            <li>Reduced Muscle Mass and Strength</li>
            <li>Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Disease, Stroke and Heart Attacks</li>
            <li>Accelerated Aging</li>
            <li>Irritability or Anger</li>
            <li>Fatigue</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Contrast this to the benefits of high testosterone. As an anabolic substance, testosterone 
causes increased protein synthesis allowing for faster and better recovery, which leads to 
increased muscle mass as well and increased bone density. Its role in sex is obvious and it 
may be even more important for attitude as it acts as a neurohormone. High testosterone 
gives you the feeling that you can “Take on the World”. For this reason optimizing testosterone has become an important part of not just performance but for health in all areas.

            We’ll be diving deep into the details of working to optimize individual hormones as listed 
earlier. All of these advanced steps work, but if you don’t cover the basics, you’re 
probably not going to get the optimal results you desire.

        <header>Battling Testosterone’s Enemies, the Anti-Androgens</header>
        
        <p>
          More important than working on increasing testosterone itself is to combat all the many things, the anti-androgens, that can diminish testosterone’s abilities, convert it to the opposite, or render it inert. We’ll be covering the increasing aspect, but this area is where to start. That’s because having good to optimal testosterone typically takes care of itself IF you do the things in this section. You are a man. You are meant to have good levels of testosterone. It’s these things that stand in the way.
        </p>
        <p>Having the lab numbers from testing is going to best allow you to narrow in on what you do. That being said, I’ve ordered these steps in a way that I think would be appropriate for just about any man to follow. The first two especially are something we MUST do living in the environment we live in today.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Limit Endocrine Disruptors</li>
            <li>Detox Endocrine Disruptors</li>

        <p>
          Now that we’ve cut down and battled the anti-androgens, the dark side of male hormone health, it’s time to focus on the light side, specifically working with testosterone and its various allies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understand that fighting the anti-androgens is probably more than half of the battle. If you take care of those things, then chances are you’ll see a big boost in your health and performance. And when you add in these steps it will do even more. Remember that many of these hormones can get trapped in vicious cycles, meaning the worse off you are the harder it 
becomes. This also means you can get stuck in the opposite, in virtuous cycles, where the better off you are, the easier it is to stay that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these steps include specific nutrients, which are necessary building blocks. From there we turn our focus to the cells themselves then the specific hormones and what we can do to increase them.
        </p>
         <ul>
            <li> Micronutrients</li>

        <header>The Macro-Nutrient Wars</header>
          <p>As you’ll come to see, the micro-nutrients that we consume, vitamins and minerals may be even more important than the macronutrients. That’s because people tend to get “enough” macronutrients, whereas they can be chronically depleted of many micronutrients.</p>
          <p>Still some focus on the three macronutrients is useful, when it comes to testosterone optimization. The three macronutrients are fat, carbohydrates and protein. Of course, not all fats are the same, not all carbs are the same, and not all protein is the same. Still, we’ll use these three groupings to talk about what is important for hormone health</p>
          <p>If we want to distill it all down to something simple, it is you want a good amount of each, carbs, protein and fat, without having too much, for optimal hormone production.</p>

        <article>
          <p>We’ve covered a ton of information. And there’s no way you can do it all so don‘t even think about that. Instead I want to break down this information into an action plan for you.The big idea behind that is that, no matter where you are at, you can continually upgrade yourself. The goal here is optimized testosterone, and of course that means optimized estrogen, aromatization, SHBG, DHT and more as well.</p>
          <p>Since this issue is bigger than most I’ve done, instead of a simple list, I’ve decided to break things up into the different big areas and then give you a checklist for each one that encapsulates just about everything from this book. Of course, more could be added but this efinitely will give you enough of a simple and advanced place to start with.</p>
            <li>Testing</li>
          <code>Blood or Saliva Test</code>

          <p>
            Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
            pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
            variables using the window.variable syntax.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
            or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
            frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
            declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an
            iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
            The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
            identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
            and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
          </p>

          <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
          <p>
            A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
            while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
          </p>

          <p>
            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
            scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
            assumed to represent a variable.
          </p>

          <p>
            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
            variable in the same scope. For example:
          </p>

          <code
            >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
            WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
            //statements }</code
          >
          However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
          statement is executed without problems.
          <code
            >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
            "otherValue";</code

        <header>Data types</header>
        <article>
          <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                <li>
                  null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                  JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                  NULL, or any other variant.
                </li>
                <li>
                  undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                </li>
                <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                <li>
                  Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                  are unique and immutable.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>and Object</li>
          </ul>
          Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
          you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
          functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
          think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
          procedures that your application can perform.

      <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
        <header>if...else statement</header>
        <article>
          Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
          true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
          condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:

          <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
          condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
          Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
          condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
          statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
          statement, including further nested if statements.
          <p>
            You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
            conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
          </p>
          <code
            >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
            statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
            statement_last; }
          </code>
          In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
          which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
          statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
          general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
          when nesting if statements:

          <code
            >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
            statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
          >
          It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
          expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
          glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
          <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use
          an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
          additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

          <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header>while statement</header>
        <article>
          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

          <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes
          false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
          the statement following the loop.

          <p>
            The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
            If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
            condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
            stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
          </p>

          <p>
            To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
            group those statements.
          </p>

          Example:

          <p>
            The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
          </p>

          <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
          <p>
            With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
            Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
            <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
            <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
            true, so the loop terminates.
          </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
        <header>Function declarations</header>
        <article>
          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
          statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

          <ul>
            <li>The name of the function.</li>
            <li>
              A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
              separated by commas.
            </li>
            <li>
              The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
              curly brackets, { }.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, the following code defines a simple function named
            square:
          </p>

          <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
          <p>
            The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
            consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
            function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
            statement specifies the value returned by the function.
          </p>
          <code>return number * number;</code>
          <p>
            Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
            value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
            changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
            globally or in the calling function.
